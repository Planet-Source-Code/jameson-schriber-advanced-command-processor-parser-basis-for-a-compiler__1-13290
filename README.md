## Advanced Command Processor/Parser \- basis for a compiler

### Description

* Perl style whitespace

support (whitespace

simply doesn't matter!)

* Unlimited number of

commands per line,

unlimited number of

arguments per command

* Commands are easy to

define using simple,

pre-designed select case

statements

* Great for anything that

needs to accept

structured input!

General syntax: Command(Argu,ment,s); Arguments can include backslash escape characters. All whitespace is stripped unless arguments are enclosed in quotes. The engine processed over 300 commands in 6 seconds on my 200Mhz machine. This would work wonders for a multi-player game,

AOL/AIM "proggie", or even as a data format. Enjoy! Please vote if you think it deserves it. Happy Holidays and support PSC!
